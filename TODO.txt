Branch zzz-characters
("zzz" to move it to the bottom of the list)
attempt to use only a supplied font

PRO:
* it makes sure that SaltGUI works properly everywhere

CON:
* it may not actually be needed, except for cases that can be solved by upgrading OS or BROWSER
* the web-fonts may actually not work in some places
* it is a bit complicated

VERDICT:
Keep until there is an actual request for it
